1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project was to make an accuarte and user-updating time clock. The user interface allowed options of adding hours, minutes, and seconds. With this, the time would adjust between A.M. and P.M. every 12 hours. This could   be used as a clock normally would, just with manual input. The main thing this code could be used for is school purposes, and teaching children how to unserstand time.

2. What did you do particularly well?

I feel that I did particularly well at writing the code regarding the instrumental pieces. This includes the ability to switch between A.M. and P.M. every 12 hours, the time not exceededing 12:59 A.M. or P.M., and the       addition needed to make it all work together when adding time. 

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could definetely use improvements on my looping skills in code. It takes me a minute still to fully comprehend what I need to do while coding loops. If I were better at these, my code regarding the loops would be a lot more precise and secure. 

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The pieces of the code that I found the hardest to work with was figuring out how to make the time switch back to 1 instead of 13, when the clock hits 12:59:59, while also changing it to A.M. or P.M. accurately. To fix this, I watched a very well done YouTube video to help me further understand if-else conditionals better. 

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

The skills that come to mind in being the most valuable from this project would have to include looping, if-else statements, and learning how to accurately set up equations. 

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I made this program maintainable and readable by doing my best to keep up with industry standards. I mainly used code that I learned from the ZYBook activities, and I believe that this helped me be more structured in the way that this project was asking for. If I was confused on any part that ZYBooks could not help me with, I looked to reputable sources that also keep up with industry standards. Doing this, I believe, made my project and adaptable as I could make it.
